Project Overview:
In this innovative project, I spearheaded the design and implementation of a robotic system aimed at automating the climbing of palm trees, a task traditionally requiring significant manual effort. The core of the system is a robotic arm controlled via a web application, enabling remote operations such as climbing, cutting, and other precision movements necessary for agricultural tasks.
